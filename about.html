                The history of post-Soviet rock in the Republic of Moldova is a concise one.
                Since 1991, only a few bands (e.g. Zdob şi Zdub), managed to occupy solid positions
                on the show-business arena of the Republic of Moldova and abroad.
                Alternosfera first rehearsed with their full lineup on December 13, 1998.
                Their first concert took place on 23 November 1999 in Chişinău.
                In 2001, the band made their first demo recordings in Chişinău, followed by more demo recordings in 2002 in Bucharest, Romania.

                Both the lineup and musical direction have changed over time, as the band reached maturity
                and developed their own approach to alternative rock, with the keyboards "carrying"
                the entire tune. Their lyrics are most often about love, but also have social and political connotations.
                Alternosfera's sound is unique on the Moldovan market at the moment, their influences varying from 80's
                motifs to the Seattle alternative rock of the '90s. Some people claim that the guitar sound in their songs is similar to Nirvana's.
                Their specific melodiousness is also partly due to most songs having the classic piano "lead".
                Alternosfera have performed on most of Chişinău's stages, taking part in the most important rock festivals in Moldova
                and were always well received by the public. In 2005 they performed in the Tuborg festival in Bucharest.
                Like most Moldovans, the band members speak Romanian as their native language, except Vlad Hohlov, who is a native Russian speaker.
